    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a wide, flat sheet of pasta. Lasagna can refer to either the type of noodle or to the typical lasagna dish which is a dish made with several layers of lasagna sheets with sauce and other ingredients, such as meats and cheese, in between the lasagna noodles.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound mild Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 (15-oz.) container part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>¼ cup refrigerated ready-made pesto</li>
        <li>1 large egg, lightly beaten</li>
        <li>2 (26-oz.) jars pasta sauce</li>
        <li>9 no-boil lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>4 cups (16 oz.) shredded Italian three-cheese blend or mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove and discard casings from sausage. Cook sausage in a large skillet over medium heat, stirring until meat crumbles and is no longer pink; drain.</li>
        <li>Stir together ricotta cheese, pesto, and egg.</li>
        <li>Spread half of 1 jar pasta sauce evenly in a lightly greased 13- x 9-inch baking dish. Layer with 3 lasagna noodles (noodles should not touch each other or sides of dish), half of ricotta mixture, half of sausage, 1 cup three-cheese blend, and remaining half of 1 jar pasta sauce. Repeat layers using 3 lasagna noodles, remaining ricotta mixture, remaining sausage, 1 cup three-cheese blend. Top with remaining 3 noodles and second jar of pasta sauce, covering noodles completely. Sprinkle evenly with remaining 2 cups three-cheese blend.</li>
        <li>Bake, covered, at 350° for 40 minutes. Uncover and bake 15 more minutes or until cheese is melted and edges are lightly browned and bubbly. Let stand 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
